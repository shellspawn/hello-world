# hello-world
My Git "Hello World" repo and a place for the future "Hello Worlds" that i will write in each language i try to learn, along with a basic reminder of how to use functions, variables etc in those languages so i may go back and go oh thats how i make a function in X language *Palms Face*..

Feel free to take and use anything that ends up here but i doubt this will end up useful to anyone but myself really!
